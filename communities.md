Samples and collections are embedded into specific user communities and organisations, and the metadata required may vary considerably between communities. At this level of detail, a “one size fits all” approach will not work. At the same time, the registration of IGSN IDSs through DataCite requires a minimum set of metadata fields defined by DataCite. As part of the IGSN DataCite partnership, the IGSN Organisation facilitates Communities of Practice to develop best practices for how samples should be described and [how the DataCite metadata fields should be populated](https://support.datacite.org/docs/igsn-id-metadata).
