The IGSN is a persistent unique identifier for physical samples and specimens that eliminates the problems associated with the ambiguous naming of samples. The IGSN registration service helps discover, access, and share samples, ensure preservation of and access to sample data, aid identification of samples in the literature, and advance the exchange of digital sample data among interoperable data systems, thus maximizing the utility of samples for research, education, and society.

## How to create and register an IGSN ##

IGSN is designed to "work offline". This means, the standard workflow is to define an IGSN and register it through an [IGSN Agent](../agents)

As an individual researcher, your IGSNs for samples will be registered on your behalf by an [IGSN Agent](../agents). Your [IGSN Agent](../agents) will advise you on [how to create an IGSN](../syntax) and how to register it.

In the DataCite system, IGSNs are DOI of the resource type "PhysicalObject".
  
## IGSN Syntax and metadata ##

The members of IGSN e.V. have put together a set of [guidelines on the IGSN syntax](../syntax) and how to use IGSN. Your [IGSN Agent](../agents) will advise you on how IGSNs are used in the respective IGSN Agent's system. 

IGSN [communities of practice](../communities) can design descriptive [metadata](../metadata) to suit their use cases. 

For registration in the DataCite system, the [IGSN Description Metadata](../metadata) are mapped to the [DataCite Metadata](https://support.datacite.org/docs/datacite-metadata-schema-44). 

## How to resolve an IGSN ##

As part of the partnership between IGSN and DataCite, IGSNs will become DataCite DOIs and can be resolved through <https://doi.org>. Exisiting IGSN will remain resolvable by using a Handle.net or DOI resolver.

     Example (IGSN):        BGRB5054RX05201
	
The address of the IGSN resolver is http://hdl.handle.net/10273

By using the URL <http://hdl.handle.net/10273/BGRB5054RX05201>, you will be automatically redirected to the web page describing this sample.

## How to use IGSN in the literature ##

The transition of IGSN into the DataCite system will require changes of how IGSNs will be embedded in publications. More detailed instructions will be published here in the near future.

## Set up a service for IGSN registration ##

To be able to register IGSN, you have to [become a member](../membership) of DataCite.  This [role](../organisation) in IGSN is called an "[IGSN Agent](../agents)".

As an IGSN Agent you will be authorised to register IGSN in the DOI prefix assigned to you.

We encourage organisations registering IGSN IDs to also [become a member](../membership) of the IGSN Implementation Organization IGSN e.V.


## Create Catalogues and Community Portals ##

There are many things you would like to know about a sample (i.e. [metadata](../metadata)) and there is no "one size fits all" solution to this question. The metadata elements that matter will depend very much on the [community of practice](../communities) that wants to share metadata and sample catalogues. This is why IGSN uses the Open Archival Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting [(OAI-PMH)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_for_Metadata_Harvesting) for sharing sample catalogues. These catalogues can be harvested and compiled into new catalogues and [community portals](../communities).

## Governance of the IGSN ##

The INGS services are operated by the International Geo Sample Number Implementation Organization (IGSN e.V.). The IGSN e.V. is an international non-profit organization that aims to implement and promote standard methods for locating, identifying, and citing physical samples collected from our natural environment, by operating an international registration service for the International Geo Sample Number (IGSN) with a distributed, sustainable infrastructure for use by and benefit to its members.

Membership in the IGSN e.V. is open to all organizations that wish to allocate IGSNs and use the Registration Agency of the IGSN e.V. in their capacity as IGSN Agents. Affiliate Membership with an advisory function is offered to organizations, who do not wish to use the IGSN eV Registration Agency as an IGSN agent, but who have an interest in promoting and supporting the purposes of the IGSN e.V.
