# How to become a member #

[Membership](../statutes) in the IGSN Implementation Organisation is open to all organisations who wish to allocate IGSN names and use the Registration Agency of IGSN in their capacity as allocating agents. Organisations interested in becoming members of the Association apply in writing to the Executive Board of the IGSN Implementation organisation.

Membership is open to organisations only, not to individuals. To become a member in the IGSN Implementation Organisation, your home institution needs to become a member of the association. Applications for membership in the IGSN Implementation Organisation must be sent in writing to the IGSN e.V. management office ([Statutes: §5 Membership Application](../statutes)).

Organisations who do not use the Registration Agency of IGSN in their capacity as allocating agents but have an interest in the purpose and objectives of the IGSN Implementation Organisation may apply for an Affiliate Membership with an advisory function and the right to attend the General Assembly.

Members will be charged an annual membership fee. The amount and due date of annual membership fees will be determined by the General Assembly. The membership fee for full members is currently € 500 per year and is due at the beginning of the calendar year.
