title: Allocating Agents
---

An Allocating Agent (see also the definition of an Allocating Agent given in the [statutes](../statutes) is an institution which allocates IGSN names on behalf of the IGSN registration agency of IGSN. An Allocating Agent may delegate technical functions and services to one or more sample repositories or data centres.

## Roles and Responsibilites ##

  * Register IGSN and [operate registration services](../system)
  * Apply for top-level [namespaces](../namespaces) from IGSN and assign sub-namespaces to its clients
  * Provide [OAI-PMH interfaces for metadata harvesting](../system)

  * Follow best practices for IGSN allocation, [syntax](../syntax) and [metadata](../metadata)
  * Ensure persistent access to the metadata record of the registered IGSN and ensure the persistence of the Allocating Agent's sample catalogue. In future, Allocating Agents will be asked to prepare a contingency plan for the case that the Allocating Agent is going out of business.
  * [Ensure uniqueness](../namespaces) of the allocated IGSN and make best effort at avoiding co-reference of IGSNs 
  * Participate in the [IGSN General Assembly](../statutes)


A failure to comply with the roles and responsibilities may result in the [termination of the membership](../statutes).
