## Registering IGSN IDs ##

IGSN IDs are functionally DOIs. This means that IGSN IDs can be generated and modified using DataCite systems and APIs, and are registered with metadata encoded in the DataCite Metadata Schema. Furthermore, IGSN IDs are distinguished from DOIs for other physical objects at the Repository account and prefix level, and therefore a new, separate IGSN ID Catalog Repository must be created that is exclusively for registering IGSN IDs.

For guidance on how to generate IGSN IDs through DataCite services, please refer to <https://support.datacite.org/docs/igsn-id-registration-guide>
