Many of Geoscience Australia's datasets are available via [web services](http://www.ga.gov.au/data-pubs/web-services), so you can serve live data directly into your hack or GIS package. Most of these services are [listed on this page](http://www.ga.gov.au/data-pubs/web-services/ga-web-services). 

There are also links to MODIS, Landsat 7, Landsat 8, TERRA and AQUA data which are available immediately after each satellite overpass - there is [more information about these data products here](http://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/earth-obs/neo-news-2013/near-real-time-satellite-imagery-products-now-available) and [technical details here](http://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/earth-obs/neo-news-2013/technical-information-on-near-real-time-data-dissemination).

Geoscience Australia also provides a large number of online tools to query parts of their data holdings - there's more information on this [page here](http://www.ga.gov.au/data-pubs/online-tools).
