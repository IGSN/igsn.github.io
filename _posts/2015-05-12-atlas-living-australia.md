The Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) is a collaborative, national project that aggregates biodiversity data from multiple sources and makes it available and usable online.

It contains a massive amount ([nearly 56 million records](http://dashboard.ala.org.au/)) of biodiversity data collated by [Australian scientific communities](http://www.ala.org.au/about-the-atlas/atlas-background/atlas-partners/partner-profiles/) and [citizen scientists](http://www.ala.org.au/get-involved/citizen-science/). Tons of geospatially located species occurences, info on those species, and APIs for uploading and accessing data.

Some of the interesting datasets are:

- **Australia's species** - Search for Australian flora and fauna species by common, scientific name or search by category.
- **Species by location** - Search by pre-defined region, or enter an address or location to find the recorded species nearby.
- **A list of collections** - which lets you learn about the collections held by institutions contributing to the ALA and view records of specimens that have been included.
- **Mapping and analysis** - A spatial portal for investigating species occurrences within specified locations and the environmental impacts.

Other features:

- The ALA includes [a sandbox](http://sandbox.ala.org.au/datacheck/) to check your data is well formatted for includsion within the ALA - this might be useful if you want your hack to produce data for inclusion.
- The ALA also has dedicated [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/ozatlas/id509021205) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.org.ala.mobile.ozatlas) apps you can use on your smartphone.

If you know what you want, then you can search for datasets directly using the [ALA's dataset search here](http://www.ala.org.au/data-sets/). There's also a [spatial query portal](http://spatial.ala.org.au/) which allows you to select data by locality - so it's easy to see what's available in a particular area you might be interested in. The ALA also provides their own web APIs for querying and discovering data - these are extensively documented with examples on the [API page](http://api.ala.org.au/).
