## Notes ##

  - EGU report
     - Splinter meeting went well, all seemed on track, there is definitely need for the IGSN
     - Question: any new interest at EGU for new members? 
       - A: Probably Woods Hole and RPI (Rensselaer Polytechnic). Lamont will set up registration effort for CZO (Critical Zone Observatories), there is also interest from Global River Observatories Effort
   - Next Activities
     - Presentation at IGC Brisbane
     - Lesley set up a workshop at IGC
     - EarthChem workshop at Goldschmidt will present on the IGSN
     - AGU session on unique identifiers
       - should start thinking about invited presentations
     - Workshop for continental scientific drilling and other core-based research (Anders)
   - Logo
     - Reviewed the logo ([[igsn:logos]]), decided to use the top white logo but remove the e.V. since it only is meaningful to German-speakers
   - Jens gave a presentation on the schema  {{:igsn:bcr_igsn_20120607.pdf|}}
     - http://trac.gfz-potsdam.de/igsn/wiki/WikiStart
     - Comment on schema by email to Jens
     - Dirk commented on the Name identification and suggested the International Author Library Identifier (?)
   - Example implementation of 9-character IGSN at the German Core Repository for ICDP.
     - Discussion: Generating the IGSN number is separate from parent-child considerations
     - Question: How do we govern who can have the 2 digit namespace? Decided by e.V. rather than allocating agent? Answer: To govern it, we need a registry of namespaces, any root namespace needs to be applied for and registered. 
     - Discussion of pros/cons of having info encoded into the IGSN
     - Discussion: one way to balance encoded information is to assign IGSNs only to the parents (cores), then append information to that IGSN for child samples (not official IGSN designations) (OSU)
