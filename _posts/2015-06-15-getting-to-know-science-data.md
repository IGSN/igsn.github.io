title: Getting to know scientific data
---

A lot of the sciency datasets can feel a bit intimidating because they sometimes require a lot of specialist knowledge to interpret, and it can be difficult to know how to interrogate them correctly.

It's often a good idea to steer clear of the field that the data was originally collected for - the scientists have probably already covered this stuff. And try to think about doing more than just 'we plotted this data on a map' - is there a cool mashup with some other data that you can use to add value to your map? Can it be used as a gateway for some other dataset?

You should think about how this information could be used in a field you're more familiar with, or with a dataset that you know more about - data mashups are definitely the way to go. And really, this is a hack so scientific rigour is not primarily what we're after (although telling us that your hack will reverse gravity won't really cut the mustard).

If you have still have questions about the details of a scientific dataset, or how to interpret it. your best bet is to ask around at the event - there will be data mentors or even other competitors who may be familiar with your selected data or something similar, even if they're not from CSIRO or GA.
