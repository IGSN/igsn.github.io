## Notes ##

   - 10:05a Kerstin opened the meeting with six people (three members, two observers, manager) in attendance
   - Kerstin appointed Jens K. as the chairperson
   - Kerstin appointed Leslie H. as the minute taker
   - Jens announced the quorum, after reviewing the statutes for the calling of Extraordinary General Assemblies and confirming with the present members.
   - Jens asked if there were any amendments to the proposed agenda and Kerstin proposed an addition to Item 6: Review of paragraph 4.2 of the statutes under Membership, "Members should be working actively with data centers for the purpose of registering IGSNs."
   - **Applications for IGSN e.V. membership:** Jens summarized that we received an application for membership from MARUM
     - The group confirmed that MARUM will set up its own registration service. Their main client is the core repository, ODP/IODP/DSDP cores from the Atlantic, Mediterranean and Arctic oceans.
     - The confirmation of MARUM was confirmed with an oral vote online.
     - Simon and Lesley gave brief updates on the application progress of their institutions (CSIRO and Geoscience Australia) - having now seen the precedent of the MARUM application, they are ready to proceed.
     - Kerstin brought up the wording "active participation" in the statues - if a member fails to attend three General Assemblies in a row, they shall be removed from the list of members. This should be checked on periodically, with emphasis on attendance at the December meetings.
   - **Review of the new draft statutes** (sent by email and attached above in the agenda)
     - Jens reviewed the recent changes, shown in the "track changes" .pdf linked above 
     - Other changes: 2.2.1 removed the duplicate "providing"
     - 2.3 The redundant English is a result of translation from German, Jens marked it as "to be edited"
     - 4.1 Makes it clear to whom membership is open.
     - 4.2 Simon proposed deletion as it did not add any information. Anthony K. officially proposed to remove 4.2. 
     - 19.4 a modification for tax law purposes
     - Jens summarized that all present members agreed on all changes during the call.
     - Signatures from all members are required for the changes
       - The minutes may be signed separately, digitally, and then combined.
       - Cover letter requires real signatures  (send the actual letter around in a set order)
   - **Actions and Resolutions**
     - MARUM's application for membership has been approved; They shall be notified.
     - Minor changes were made to the statutes, after review and discussion. All members must sign to change the statutes
     - Action: Cover letter for the new statutes must signed on the hardcopy (make an order for signatures and note addresses)
     - Action: Email to all members that the new statutes were approved
   - **Micellaneous**
     - **KL proposes that Monday, Dec. 9th, 7 AM PST be reserved for the IGSN General Assembly**
     - Kerstin proposed that there is a Town Hall at AGU on samples again
     - Kerstin brings up the AGU booth, if split with two other groups, will be $800
         - Anthony K. supports having a booth at AGU
         - There is no disagreement about the booth and all express willingness to be at the booth
     - KL: The AGU session on Unique Identifiers was accepted
     - JK Attended a meeting recently and had interest from the Research Center Ulich (get correct spelling)
     - KL: Should contact the Japanese in order to expand the international nature of the IGSN e.V.
     - KL gave a brief update on Marine Curators Meeting
       - AK: the repositories could become Associate Members if interested (do not have to become allocating agents)
     - UK involvement could be pursued to make the association more international
     - KL: Last year we were in contact with IUGS, we should contact them again. The concern is to get new organizations in Europe and Asia. SC suggests that IUGS/OGC will not contribute to social traction in academia.
     - All members should suggest ways of promoting IGSN on an international basis.
   - Jens ended the General Assembly at 11:11 EDT.
