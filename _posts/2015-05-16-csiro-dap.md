The CSIRO Data Access Portal provides access to data published by CSIRO across a range of disciplines. It gives access to CC-BY and CSIRO Data License datasets with a diverse range of subjects including [pulsars](https://data.csiro.au/dap/search?q=Pulsars&p=1&rpp=25&sb=RELEVANCE&dr=all&soud=on) to [viruses](https://data.csiro.au/dap/search?tn=Veterinary%20Virology), [ontologies](http://dx.doi.org/10.4225/08/537452F354E36) to [genomics](https://data.csiro.au/dap/search?q=genomics&p=1&rpp=25&sb=RELEVANCE&dr=all&soud=on), [seabed sediments](https://data.csiro.au/dap/search?q=seabed%20sediments&p=1&rpp=25&sb=RELEVANCE) to [solar radiation](https://data.csiro.au/dap/search?q=solar%20radiation&p=1&rpp=25&sb=RELEVANCE)

There is a browser interface to browse by subject area, search by keyword, search by location, download files. All help documentation is [here](https://wiki.csiro.au/display/dmsdoc/Find+Data). There are a few things to watch out for though:

- Beware licences- some data collections specify No Derivatives, some specify Non Commercial reuse.
- Beware collections with public metadata but non public data. After searching, use the Show ONLY option in the Refine Results column to limit to those collections with public data.
- Beware large collections (>1GB) - check special download instuctions for these [here](https://wiki.csiro.au/display/dmsdoc/Large+Collection+Access+%28non-CSIRO+Users%29)
- There is an API which can be used to access the catalog content, [see here](https://wiki.csiro.au/display/dmsdoc/Web+Services+Interface).

Feedback is welcome. If you have anything to tell us about the data you find, its usability, the usability of the DAP please let us know via <mailto:researchdatasupport@csiro.au>. If you know of [CSIRO research](http://www.csiro.au) that may be generating data that you could have used for an idea but you can't find the data please also let us know.
