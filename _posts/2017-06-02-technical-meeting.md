## Schema release ##
Release schema.
Next iteration: review repository information (trusted, access, â€¦)

## Trustworthiness of allocators (DSA/WDS) ##
What are the quality criteria for IGSN metadata? (Five Star Metadata)

## IGSN.org Website ##
Upgrade of website. Send email to members describing the upgrade and give two weeks notice to object.
Agents Websites
Supply users with information about how to register IGSN. Identify and describe use cases. This should be a funded research project.
Update contacts. Discuss roles in IGSN in analogy to DNS roles.
Registration of individual samples should include feedback to user about the quality attributes of the entered metadata.

## IGSN Roadmap Project ##
Registry of sample repositories. Certification of trustworthiness.
Roles and responsibilities, governance and maintenance.
Services, APIs, upgrade to new DataCite infrastructure components and technological alignment. DataCite as the technology platform? Discuss at RDA Montreal.
Cross-linking to other resources by PID and LOD.
Consider adding: block of work with publishers - integrate IGSN with manuscript submission systems; validation process; how to cite and link IGSNs in papers


## Recommended PID for related objects, ORCID integration ##
ORCID, organisations (TBD), various DOIs, FundRef.
SCHOLIX must clarify encoding of relationships between authors, publications, data, samples.

## Scope of the Validation Service ##
Use case: check on the existence of identifiers
Target Audience: Publishers and Editors
Solution: Web form
 
Use case: bulk checking of IGSN registration and metadata completeness (overview representation)
Target Audience: IGSN Agents, Publishers, Repositories
 
Use case: check resolution of existing IGSN and check metadata.
Target: IGSN e.V. Registry and Agents


## IGSN Paper ##
  - Rationale
  - Global perspective
  - Governance model
  - Based on existing technology and community
  - Contrast to Groom et al. (2017) Nature: http://doi.org/10.1038/546033d
  - Status (history and operational status, examples of implementations)
  - Identify and link functionality/purpose of IGSN 
  - Examples for use of IGSN in the literature
  - Future outlook
 
 
# Action Items #
  - Pursue a side meeting with DataCite at RDA P10 - Kerstin
  - Send email to members about website - Kerstin
  - Release schema - Jens
  - Start next iteration of schema
  - Contact members about contacts, web presence, services offered.
  - Build developer community around IGSN, best practice documentations, reference implementation. Use GitHub site.
  - Review accepted PID for related objects. Compile list and put up for vote. (Bob Arko)
  - Develop criteria for 5 Star Metadata.
  - Fix SSL certificate for ORCID integration (see https://trello.com/c/dvfRZbSA/3672-add-igsn-identifier) (Bob)
