title: An interactive geological map in Minecraft for Raspberry Pi
---

Note: the geological map for Australia is available from Geoscience Australia via a Web Feature Service with a _lot_ of data behind it so maybe just concentrate on a small area. You can request just the data lying within a bounding box - find a geospatial expert and ask them how.

# Datasets & resources

- **Geological data for Australia from Geoscience Australia** 

- **Shapely and Rasterio** - for handling vector and raster mapping data in Python
- **RaspPi Python API**
- **Bukkit** - open source minecraft server
- **RaspberryJuice** - an open implementation of the RaspPi server API
- **Surface data from SLIP** - add roads and cities over your geology!
