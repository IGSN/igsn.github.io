# Ideas

Here's a few ideas of mashups and interesting data uses teams can feel free to steal.

## An interactive geological map in Minecraft for Raspberry Pi



Note: the geological map for Australia is available from Geoscience Australia via a Web Feature Service with a _lot_ of data behind it so maybe just concentrate on a small area. You can request just the data lying within a bounding box - find a geospatial expert and ask them how.

### Datasets & resources

Geological data for Australia from Geoscience Australia.
Surface data from SLIP - add roads and cities over your geology!
Shapely - for handling vector mapping data in Python
RaspPi Python API
Bukkit - open source minecraft server
RaspberryJuice - an open implementation of the RaspPi server API

## Landuse changes around cities/mines/ports/<x> over time

Using Landsat data to look at changes in land use - who has had the biggest imapact as seen from space?

### Datasets & resources

AWS has a hosted version of the landsat data available to use
OpenCV image processing
