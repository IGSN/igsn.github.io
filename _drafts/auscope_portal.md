The AuScope portal contains a huge variety of Australia-wide geospatial and geoscientific datasets from the CSIRO, Geoscience Australia, the state Geological Surveys and several Australian universities. If you're interested in accessing the API's, a how-to for the [mine location/mineral occurrence data is here](https://twiki.auscope.org/wiki/CoreLibrary/ERMLGovHackOerview) and the [borehole data here](https://twiki.auscope.org/wiki/CoreLibrary/NVCLGovHackOverview).
