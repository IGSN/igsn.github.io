The Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) contains a massive amount of biodiversity data collated by [Australian scientific communities](http://www.ala.org.au/about-the-atlas/atlas-background/atlas-partners/partner-profiles/) and [citizen scientists](http://www.ala.org.au/get-involved/citizen-science/).

Tons of geospatially located species occurences, info on those species, apis for uploading data etc etc etc.

# How do I get my hands on some data?
