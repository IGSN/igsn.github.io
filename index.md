# IGSN and DataCite #

In September 2021, IGSN and DataCite signed a Memorandum of Agreement between the two organisations towards a partnership that intends to support the global adoption, implementation, and use of physical sample identifiers. This collaboration is aligned with our respective missions and brings together the strengths of each organization for the benefit of the research community.

# IGSN #

The IGSN is a persistent unique identifier for physical samples and specimens that eliminates the problems associated with the ambiguous naming of samples. Because of its origin from the geosciences, its original name was the Internationa Geo Sample Number. Since then the scope of IGSN has been expanded to any physical specimen. 

The IGSN registration service will facilitate the discovery, access, and sharing of samples, ensure preservation and access of sample data, aid identification of samples in the literature, and advance the exchange of digital sample data among interoperable data systems, thus maximizing the utility of samples for research, education, and society.

  * [Syntax](../syntax): Guidelines for forming IGSN for registration.
  * [Metadata](../metadata): Metadata for registration of IGSN and for description of samples.
  * [Namespaces](../namespaces): This is how we govern namespaces for IGSN. List of IGSN namespaces currently in use.

# IGSN Technical Implementation #

**Please note!** IGSN and DataCite have entered an agreement that will transfer the service of mining IGSN identifiers into the DataCite infrastructure. Many technical details outlined in this wiki will change after December 2021.

# IGSN - International GeoSample Number Implementation Organization e.V. #

The IGSN eV is an international non-profit organization that aims to implement and promote standard methods for locating, identifying, and citing physical samples collected from our natural environment, by operating an international registration service for the IGSN with a distributed, sustainable infrastructure for use by and benefit to its members.

  * [Statutes](../statutes) of the IGSN Implementation Organization e.V. (IGSN e.V.)
  * [Membership](../membership) list and how to become a member of IGSN e.V.
  * [Allocating Agents](../agents): Information about function and duties of IGSN Allocating Agents.
  * [Minutes](../minutes) from meetings and telecons
  * [Publications](../publications) on IGSN and related literature
  
Membership in the IGSN e.V. is open to all organizations that wish to allocate IGSNs and use the Registration Agency of the IGSN e.V. in their capacity as Allocating Agents. Affiliate Membership with an advisory function is offered to organizations, who do not wish to use the IGSN eV Registration Agency as an allocating agent, but who have an interest in promoting and supporting the purposes of the IGSN e.V.
